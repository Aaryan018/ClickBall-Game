# ClickBall-Game
It is a click game in which a ball appears randomly within every 5 seconds. If the user clicks the ball, the hit count increases by one and the ball disappears and appears randomly again within 5 seconds. Each time the ball is clicked or missed, its speed increases the next time it comes. If the user is unable to click the ball, miss count increases. When the miss count reaches 5, the game stops and the Game Over message pops up. Also, the user can pause and reset the game. A ball cannot be clicked when the game is paused.
